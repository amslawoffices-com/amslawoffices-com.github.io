A Chapter 7 discharge eliminates most unsecured debts entirely and is often the best option for people without the disposable income to make a Chapter 13 work. "Bankruptcy gives to the honest but unfortunate debtor ... a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort." This was said originally by the United States Supreme Court in Local Loan Co. v. Hunt (1934) 292 U.S. 234, 244.</p><h3 id="what-debts-are-discharged-in-chapter-7" tabindex="-1">What Debts Are Discharged in Chapter 7 <a class="direct-link" href="#what-debts-are-discharged-in-chapter-7" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><ul><li>Car loans (creditor will retain lien)</li><li>Credit Cards</li><li>Deficiency balances on homes, cars, boats, etc. following foreclosure or repossession</li><li>Medical bills</li><li>Mortgages (creditor will retain lien)</li><li>Most lawsuits</li></ul><h3 id="what-debts-are-not-discharged-by-chapter-7" tabindex="-1">What Debts Are Not Discharged by Chapter 7 <a class="direct-link" href="#what-debts-are-not-discharged-by-chapter-7" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><ul><li>Debts for personal injuries caused by the debtor operating a vehicle while intoxicated</li><li>Debts incurred to pay nondischargeable taxes</li><li>Debts not properly listed in the schedules</li><li>Domestic support obligations such as spousal maintenance or child support</li><li>Most student loans</li><li>Most taxes (some older income taxes may be discharged)</li><li>Reaffirmed debts</li></ul></article><hr><ul><li>Next: <a href="/articles/sole-proprietorship-bankruptcy-covid/">Does Your Sole Proprietorship Need to Bankrupt Because Of COVID?</a></li></ul></main><footer><span id="copyright"><small>Â© Copyright 2020 by Adele Schneidereit</small></span><div><small><a href="https://g.page/r/CREPYNswRnacEAg/review">Leave us a review!</a> <small></small></small></div></footer></body></html>
