If you created a business but did not file the necessary papers to form a corporation or LLC, the business is a sole proprietorship by default. Legally, there is no separation between a sole proprietorship and you. A creditor can sue personally for the business's debts and take your personal assets, such as your car, home, or money in your personal checking or savings accounts to satisfy a judgment. You need to file bankruptcy personally.</p><p>Because of repeated COVID closures or otherwise, if your sole proprietorship is struggling with mounting debt, you can file bankruptcy in one of two ways, Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. Once bankruptcy proceedings are started, creditors cannot attempt to collect debt from you or the business until the bankruptcy process has ended.</p><p>Chapter 7 bankruptcy can eliminate most or all of your and your business's debts. Yet, after a chapter 7 bankruptcy, the business is unlikely to continue. You will be allowed to keep some "tools of the trade."</p><p>Chapter 11 bankruptcy is used by people who want to continue operating a business and repay creditors throughout the court approved payment plan. Property is not sold, but the debts must be eventually repaid.</p><p>More on other types of business bankruptcy in later articles.</p></article><hr><ul><li>Next: <a href="/articles/car-with-outstanding-loan-chapter-7-bankruptcy/">Options for A Car with An Outstanding Loan In A Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</a></li><li>Previous: <a href="/articles/what-is-chapter-7-bankruptcy/">What Is Chapter 7 Bankruptcy?</a></li></ul></main><footer><span><small>Â© Copyright 2020 by Adele Schneidereit</small></span><div><small><a href="https://g.page/r/CREPYNswRnacEAg/review">Leave us a review!</a> <small></small></small></div></footer></body></html>
