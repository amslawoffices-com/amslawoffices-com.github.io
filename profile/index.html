<h2>Client Testimonials</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>
Adele Schneidereit helped us hold our builder responsible when a roof leak in our bedroom ceiling led to mold damage that had to be professionally remediated.
Before Adele's involvement in our case, our calls and emails were ignored by the builder; after Adele helped us draft a clear letter stating our rights, the builder suddenly became responsive and everything was taken care of quickly and to our satisfaction.
Adele is clearly passionate about helping advocate for the "little guy" whose voices are so often discounted in our society.
She was wonderful to work with!
