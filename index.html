In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, we can zero out most of your debts. Most people have better credit one year after bankruptcy than they had going into bankruptcy. Bankruptcy allows people to focus on their current expenses and not get bogged down servicing past debt.</p><h3>Probate</h3><p>Probate is a legal process in a local court. The goal of a probate is paying the deceased person's debts, then dispensing the remaining property as directed by the will. If there's no will, this is called "intestate." If the deceased person died intestate, distribution will be directed by state law.</p><h3>Trust and Estates</h3><p>Estate planning is a process where an experienced attorney assists you with putting into action your final financial and healthcare directions to ensure that they will be honored upon your death or incapacitation. Estate planning is the best way to ensure that your children, spouse, pets, and other loved ones will be taken care of after you have left this world.</p><h3>Latest articles</h3><ul reversed class="articlelist" style="counter-reset: start-from 9"><li class="articlelist-item"><a href="/articles/removing-property-from-irrevocable-trust-in-ca/" class="articlelist-link">Removing Property from An Irrevocable Trust in CA Is A No No</a> <small><time class="articlelist-date" datetime="2021-09-07">07 Sep 2021</time></small> <a href="/tags/estate-planning/" class="article-tag">estate planning</a> <a href="/tags/probate/" class="article-tag">probate</a> <a href="/tags/litigation/" class="article-tag">litigation</a></li><li class="articlelist-item"><a href="/articles/transfer-on-death-deed/" class="articlelist-link">Problems with Transfer on Death Deed in California</a> <small><time class="articlelist-date" datetime="2021-08-24">24 Aug 2021</time></small> <a href="/tags/estate-planning/" class="article-tag">estate planning</a></li><li class="articlelist-item"><a href="/articles/student-loans-and-bankruptcy/" class="articlelist-link">Student Loans Can Be Zeroed Out Through Bankruptcy</a> <small><time class="articlelist-date" datetime="2021-08-24">24 Aug 2021</time></small> <a href="/tags/bankruptcy/" class="article-tag">bankruptcy</a></li></ul><small>More articles can be found <a href="/articles/">here</a>.</small></main><footer><span><small>Â© Copyright&nbsp;<script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear());</script>&nbsp;Law Offices of Adele Schneidereit</small></span><div><small><a href="https://g.page/r/CREPYNswRnacEAg/review">Leave us a review!</a> <small></small></small></div></footer></body></html>
